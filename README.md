# Moki - [experimental]
*... mocks your backend*

Moki is an easy way to mock a rest-api and is usefull for Web- & Mobile-developers
to build rest-based clients without the needs to run a real server.

**Important:** *This software is permanently in development, so please use it carefuly.*

**Important**: nodejs from V.6 doesn't support EventEmitter. So you will get a warning in console. currently i test this project only until v5.




## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

Frontend-developers doesn't like to work with broken services.
They prefer to write UI code and expects a full working service with predictable behaviour.
Later, if a product has a bug and for example fails in user acceptance tests, then a frontend-developer
 is the first instance who will be asked by the customer. The web-developer has to explain why the application doesn't
 work as expected. Even if the problem is a produced by a broken service.

Moki is a way to setup a rest-api with static (and dynamic) responses. So a web-developer get simple
a way to develop against a not implemented service. Web-developer can configure response in different way,
depends on a catched request and matched parameters.

## Goals & Features

* Simple way to setup a rest-api.
* Run a rest-api.
* Static & dynamic json responses


## Getting started

### Requirements

* nodejs
* npm

### Installation

Install moki with npm. To install moki global accessible you can use the -g option:

   > npm install -g moki



### Working directory
   Change to (project-) directory where you want to manage your rest-api mocks.

### Configure mocks

To create a mock for a specified rest-request moki supports a json-based dsl.
This json file with some mock-declarations inside we will call 'usecase'.

**Example:**
````json
{
  "mocks" : [{

    "on" : {
      "endpoint": {
        "method": "get",
        "pattern": "/items",
        "path": "/items"
      }

    },

    "action" : { "items" : ["Apple", "Pineapple"] }
  }]
}
````

Save this content in a text file './usecases/usecase-1.json'.


### Run

To run moki with above described usecase open command line and enter:

   >moki run usecase-1

Moki will resolve the name of usecase to a file, load the mock-declarations and start the server at
http://localhost:8383/.

To test the endpoint open in the browser this url:
   http://localhost:8383/items

**Important:** http-Port is configurable

# Versioning

I will use the 0.0.0 versioning pattern. I've started the publishing on npm with version 1.0.0. Even until this moment the application is not production stable. I plan to get usefull stability with the release 1.1.0. Until this moment i will increment the minor number with every publishing.

## History

**v.1.0.12** project (rest-api-mock) was renamed to moki and republished at npm.

**before v1.0.11** *this application was published as npm module called 'rest-api-mock'.*
