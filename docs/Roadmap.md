# Roadmap

## Versioning

I will use the 0.0.0 versioning pattern. I've started the publishing on npm with version 1.0.0. Even until this moment the application is not production stable. I plan to get usefull stability with the release 1.1.0. Until this moment i will increment the minor number with every publishing.

## before Version 1.1.0

**v.1.0.12** project (rest-api-mock) was renamed to moki and republished at npm.

**before v1.0.11** *this application was published as npm module called 'rest-api-mock'.*

## Version 1.1.0

Main goal of this release is stability with minimal functions.

### Goals

* Stable minimal API to configure and start a server.
* Simple JSON-DSL to configure Mocks
* Validating schemes for api-specs
* Run rest-api with mocks
* Noce cli logs
* JSON-Request logs in a file (bunyan)
